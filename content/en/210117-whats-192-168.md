A Internet spec called  [RFC 1918](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1918.txt) (Request For Comments) reserved a few blocks of addressnss for "private" network. 192.168/16 was one of those blocks.

## LONGLY

Origin text is following:
>  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the following three blocks of the IP address space for private internets:
>
> -   10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix)
> -   172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix)
> - 192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)

- 256\*256\*256\*256 = 4294967296

Old time dont warry about NAT(Network Address Translation) port forwarding/mapping or ALGs or DMZs or trigger ports or hairpinning. To handle the problem runing out of addresses too quickly, IANA ( [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](http://iana.org/) ) made ISPs to get address. By the time home boardband and network really start.

**HOW WORKS**

>  So if you wanted to get more than one machine in your household onto the Internet, you had to run a NAT gateway that fakes like all the machines on your home network are actually sharing the same single public IP address. But all those other machines on your home network needed their own private IP addresses to use to talk to the NAT gateway.
